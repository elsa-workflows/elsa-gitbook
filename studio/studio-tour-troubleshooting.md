## Creating Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow step-by-step.

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Navigate to **Workflows** from the left menu
2. Click **"Create Workflow"** button
3. Enter workflow details:
   - **Name**: "Hello World"
   - **Description**: "My first Elsa workflow"
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Add Activities

1. **Add a WriteLine Activity**:
   - Find "WriteLine" in the Activity Toolbox (under Console or Diagnostics)
   - Drag it onto the canvas
   - Click the activity to select it

2. **Configure WriteLine**:
   - In the Properties Panel, under **Input** tab:
   - **Text**: Enter `"Hello, Elsa!"` (use Literal syntax)
   - Note: The activity is now configured to log this message

3. **Add a Delay Activity**:
   - Drag "Delay" from toolbox onto canvas
   - Place it to the right of WriteLine

4. **Configure Delay**:
   - Select the Delay activity
   - **Duration**: Enter `00:00:02` (2 seconds) or use C# expression: `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)`

5. **Add Another WriteLine**:
   - Drag another WriteLine activity
   - **Text**: `"Workflow completed!"`

### Step 3: Connect Activities

1. Click the **output port** (right side) of the first WriteLine
2. Drag to the **input port** (left side) of the Delay activity
3. Connect Delay to the second WriteLine

Your workflow should show: `WriteLine → Delay → WriteLine`

### Step 4: Save and Publish

1. Click **"Save"** in the toolbar
2. Click **"Publish"** to activate the workflow
3. Confirm publication

### Step 5: Run the Workflow

1. Click the **Run button** (▶️) in the toolbar
2. Watch as the workflow executes
3. Check the **Workflow Instances** to see the execution result

## Debugging Workflow Execution

Debugging is essential for understanding why workflows behave unexpectedly.

### Using the Execution Journal

The execution journal is your primary debugging tool.

**Accessing the Journal:**

1. Go to **Workflow Instances**
2. Find your workflow execution
3. Click to view details
4. Navigate to the **Journal** or **Timeline** tab

**What to Look For:**

- **Activity Sequence**: Verify activities executed in the expected order
- **Activity States**: 
  - ✅ Completed successfully
  - ❌ Faulted (error occurred)
  - ⏸️ Suspended (waiting)
- **Timestamps**: Identify slow activities
- **Input/Output Values**: Check if data is correct
- **Outcomes**: Verify branching logic (e.g., "Done", "200", "404")

**Example Journal Entry:**

```
[2025-11-20 10:30:15] WriteLine (Activity1) - Completed
  Input: Text = "Hello, Elsa!"
  Outcome: Done

[2025-11-20 10:30:15] Delay (Activity2) - Completed
  Input: Duration = 00:00:02
  Outcome: Done

[2025-11-20 10:30:17] WriteLine (Activity3) - Completed
  Input: Text = "Workflow completed!"
  Outcome: Done
```

### Understanding Workflow States

- **Running**: Workflow is actively executing
- **Suspended**: Workflow is waiting for:
  - External event (e.g., HTTP request, timer)
  - User input
  - Bookmark to be resumed
- **Finished**: All activities completed successfully
- **Faulted**: An error occurred, workflow stopped
- **Cancelled**: Manually stopped by user or system

### Common Error Patterns

#### Expression Errors

**Problem**: Expression syntax errors prevent activity execution

**Symptoms:**
- Activity shows error icon
- Journal shows "Expression evaluation failed"
- Workflow enters Faulted state

**Example Error:**
```
Expression evaluation failed: variables.OrderTotal is undefined
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Variable Exists**: Ensure variable is created and spelled correctly
2. **Verify Syntax**: Match expression syntax to selected language
   - JavaScript: `variables.OrderTotal`
   - C#: `Variables.OrderTotal`
   - Liquid: `{{ Variables.OrderTotal }}`
3. **Check Variable Initialization**: Make sure variable is set before use
4. **Use WriteLine for Debugging**: Log variable values to verify data

#### Null Reference Errors

**Problem**: Accessing properties of null objects

**Symptoms:**
- "Object reference not set to an instance of an object"
- Activity fails unexpectedly

**Example:**
```csharp
Variables.User.Email  // User is null
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Null Check**: Use conditional logic
   ```csharp
   Variables.User != null ? Variables.User.Email : "No email"
   ```
2. **Safe Navigation** (C#):
   ```csharp
   Variables.User?.Email ?? "No email"
   ```
3. **Default Values**: Initialize variables with default values

#### Connection Errors

**Problem**: Activities not properly connected

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow stops after first activity
- Some activities never execute

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Connections**: Ensure all activities are connected
2. **Verify Outcomes**: Connect to correct outcome port (e.g., "Done", "True", "False")
3. **Visual Inspection**: Follow the flow from start to end

#### HTTP Activity Errors

**Problem**: HTTP Request activities fail

**Common Errors:**

1. **404 Not Found**
   - URL is incorrect
   - Solution: Verify URL, check for typos

2. **401 Unauthorized**
   - Missing or invalid authentication
   - Solution: Add headers with authorization token

3. **Timeout**
   - Server not responding
   - Solution: Increase timeout, check server availability

4. **SSL/TLS Errors**
   - Certificate validation failed
   - Solution: Check server certificate, consider bypassing validation (dev only)

**Example HTTP Request Configuration:**

```javascript
// URL (C#)
return $"https://api.example.com/users/{Variables.UserId}";

// Headers (JavaScript)
{
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${variables.ApiToken}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Debugging Techniques

#### 1. Use WriteLine Liberally

Add WriteLine activities to log variable values:

```javascript
// Log variable value
`UserId: ${variables.UserId}, Total: ${variables.OrderTotal}`
```

#### 2. Check Variable Values in Journal

The execution journal shows input/output values for each activity.

#### 3. Test Expressions Independently

Use a Set Variable activity to test complex expressions:

```csharp
// Test this expression
Variables.Orders.Where(x => x.Total > 1000).Count()
```

#### 4. Simplify Complex Workflows

- Comment out activities temporarily
- Test one path at a time
- Gradually add complexity

#### 5. Use Conditional Breakpoints

Add If activities with logging to trace execution:

```javascript
// Condition
variables.Debug === true

// Log in True branch
`Debug: At checkpoint 1, UserId = ${variables.UserId}`
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Design-Time Errors

#### Cannot Save Workflow

**Symptoms:**
- Save button doesn't work
- Error message appears

**Common Causes:**
1. **Validation Errors**: Activities have invalid configurations
2. **Disconnected Activities**: Orphaned activities on canvas
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Activities reference each other cyclically

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Activity Validation**: Look for red indicators on activities
2. **Review Connections**: Ensure all activities are properly connected
3. **Remove Unused Activities**: Delete orphaned activities
4. **Simplify**: Break complex workflows into smaller workflows

#### Activity Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Activity shows error icon
- Cannot publish workflow

**Common Issues:**

1. **Missing Required Fields**
   - Solution: Fill in all required input fields

2. **Invalid Expression Syntax**
   - Solution: Test expressions in a simple Set Variable activity first

3. **Type Mismatch**
   - Solution: Ensure variable types match expected inputs
   - Example: Don't pass a string to an integer field

#### Variables Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Variable not in dropdown
- Expression can't access variable

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Scope**: Ensure variable is created at workflow level
2. **Refresh**: Save and reload the workflow
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Match exact variable name (case-sensitive in some contexts)
4. **Create Explicitly**: Use Variables panel to create variables

### Runtime Failures

#### Workflow Doesn't Start

**Symptoms:**
- Trigger doesn't fire
- No instance created

**Common Causes:**

1. **Workflow Not Published**
   - Solution: Publish the workflow

2. **Trigger Activity Not Configured**
   - Solution: Check "Trigger Workflow" in activity's Common properties

3. **HTTP Endpoint Path Conflict**
   - Solution: Ensure path is unique across workflows

4. **Server Not Running**
   - Solution: Verify Elsa Server is running and accessible

#### Workflow Gets Stuck in Running State

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow shows "Running" indefinitely
- Never completes or suspends

**Common Causes:**

1. **Infinite Loop**
   - While or ForEach without exit condition
   - Solution: Add proper exit conditions

2. **Blocking Activity Without Timeout**
   - HTTP Request hanging
   - Solution: Set timeout values

3. **Deadlock**
   - Circular bookmark dependencies
   - Solution: Review workflow logic, simplify

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check execution journal to see last completed activity
2. Review activity after last completed one
3. Add timeout configurations
4. Cancel and redesign problematic section

#### Workflow Fails Silently

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow finishes but doesn't produce expected results
- No errors shown

**Common Causes:**

1. **Exception Swallowed**
   - Try-catch blocks without logging
   - Solution: Add error logging

2. **Wrong Branch Taken**
   - Conditional logic error
   - Solution: Add WriteLine to log which branch executes

3. **Variable Not Updated**
   - Expression doesn't modify variable as expected
   - Solution: Log variable values before and after

#### Data Loss in Variables

**Symptoms:**
- Variable values disappear
- Variables reset unexpectedly

**Common Causes:**

1. **Wrong Storage Location**
   - Using "Memory" storage for long-running workflows
   - Solution: Use "Workflow Instance" storage

2. **Variable Scope Issues**
   - Activity-scoped variable not accessible
   - Solution: Use workflow-level variables

3. **Overwriting Variables**
   - Multiple Set Variable activities with same variable
   - Solution: Review all assignments to the variable

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Workflow Execution

**Symptoms:**
- Workflows take longer than expected
- Timeouts occur

**Common Causes:**

1. **Expensive Operations in Loops**
   - API calls inside ForEach
   - Solution: Batch operations, use parallel processing

2. **Large Data Sets**
   - Processing thousands of records
   - Solution: Implement pagination, chunking

3. **Synchronous HTTP Requests**
   - Waiting for multiple API calls sequentially
   - Solution: Use parallel HTTP activities or bulk operations

4. **No Indexes on Database**
   - Slow database queries
   - Solution: Optimize database schema

**Optimization Tips:**

1. **Use Bulk Operations**
   ```csharp
   // Instead of loop with API calls
   // Use single bulk API call
   ```

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Use ParallelForEach for independent operations

3. **Cache Results**
   - Store frequently used data in variables

4. **Optimize Expressions**
   - Complex LINQ queries can be slow
   - Pre-filter data before processing

#### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- Server runs out of memory
- Workflows fail with OutOfMemoryException

**Common Causes:**

1. **Loading Large Objects**
   - Entire file loaded into memory
   - Solution: Stream data instead

2. **Many Long-Running Workflows**
   - Each suspended workflow consumes memory
   - Solution: Configure workflow persistence, use retention policies

3. **Variable Storage**
   - Large objects in Workflow Instance storage
   - Solution: Use external storage for large data

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Streaming**
   - Process files in chunks
   - Don't load entire file into variable

2. **Clean Up Variables**
   - Remove large variables when no longer needed

3. **Configure Retention**
   - Automatically clean up completed workflow instances

4. **Use External Storage**
   - Store large files in blob storage
   - Store references in workflow variables

#### Workflow Instance Database Growth

**Symptoms:**
- Database size grows rapidly
- Queries become slow

**Solutions:**

1. **Configure Retention Policies**
   ```csharp
   // In Elsa Server configuration
   services.AddElsa(elsa => elsa
       .UseWorkflowManagement(management => management
           .SetWorkflowInstanceRetention(TimeSpan.FromDays(30))));
   ```

2. **Disable Activity State Persistence** (when not needed)
   - Use LogPersistenceMode property

3. **Archive Old Instances**
   - Move completed instances to archive storage
   - Keep only recent data in primary database

4. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Schedule maintenance jobs to delete old instances

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

#### 1. Keep It Simple

- **One Responsibility**: Each workflow should have a single, clear purpose
- **Modular Design**: Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable workflows
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Activities, variables, and workflows should have clear names

**Example:**
```
❌ Bad: "Activity1", "Activity2", "temp"
✅ Good: "FetchUserData", "ValidateOrder", "customerEmail"
```

#### 2. Document Your Workflows

- Add descriptions to workflows
- Use comments in activities (via Description field)
- Document complex expressions

#### 3. Error Handling

- Anticipate failures
- Add error handling branches
- Log errors for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages

**Example Error Handling:**

```
HTTP Request
├─ 200 OK → Process Response
├─ 404 Not Found → Handle Missing Resource
├─ 500 Server Error → Retry Logic
└─ Timeout → Alert and Fail Gracefully
```

#### 4. Variable Management

- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase or PascalCase consistently
- **Minimize Scope**: Use activity-scoped variables when possible
- **Appropriate Storage**: Match storage to workflow lifetime
- **Type Safety**: Use specific types instead of Object when possible

#### 5. Testing Strategy

- **Test Each Path**: Verify all conditional branches
- **Test Edge Cases**: Empty data, null values, maximum values
- **Test Error Scenarios**: Simulate failures
- **Use Test Data**: Don't test with production data

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Avoid Unnecessary Persistence

- Use "Memory" storage for transient data
- Configure LogPersistenceMode to reduce database writes

#### 2. Batch Operations

- Process records in batches instead of one-by-one
- Use bulk APIs when available

#### 3. Caching

- Cache frequently accessed data
- Reuse API responses within workflow

#### 4. Async Operations

- Use asynchronous activities for I/O operations
- Enable parallel execution where appropriate

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Protect Sensitive Data

- Don't log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Use secure storage for credentials
- Encrypt sensitive variables

#### 2. Validate Inputs

- Always validate external inputs
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks
- Check for expected data types

#### 3. Use HTTPS

- Always use HTTPS for HTTP activities
- Validate SSL certificates

#### 4. Implement Authorization

- Check user permissions in workflows
- Don't expose sensitive endpoints without authentication

### Maintainability

#### 1. Version Control

- Use workflow versioning
- Document changes between versions
- Keep old versions for rollback

#### 2. Consistent Style

- Establish team conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Apply same design patterns across workflows

#### 3. Code Reuse

- Create reusable workflows
- Use workflow variables for configuration
- Share common logic via Dispatch Workflow activity

## Tips for Efficient Workflow Design

### Quick Tips

1. **Use Search**: Press `/` to search for activities quickly
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn common shortcuts (see below)
3. **Auto-Layout**: Use layout button to organize activities automatically
4. **Duplicate Workflows**: Start from existing workflows when possible
5. **Test Incrementally**: Test after adding each major section
6. **Use Templates**: Create template workflows for common patterns
7. **Version Before Major Changes**: Publish a version before significant modifications

### Keyboard Shortcuts

*Note: Shortcuts may vary depending on your Elsa Studio version and browser.*

### Common Workflow Patterns

#### 1. Request-Response Pattern

```
HTTP Endpoint → Process Request → HTTP Response
```

**Use Case**: REST API endpoints, webhooks

#### 2. Retry Pattern

```
HTTP Request → Check Status
├─ Success → Continue
└─ Failure → Delay → Retry (loop back)
```

**Use Case**: Resilient API calls

#### 3. Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern

```
Start → ParallelForEach → Process Items → Join Results
```

**Use Case**: Parallel processing of items

#### 4. Saga Pattern

```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
  ↓       ↓       ↓
Compensate 1 ← Compensate 2 ← Compensate 3
```

**Use Case**: Distributed transactions with rollback

#### 5. Event Listener Pattern

```
Event Trigger (suspend) → Wait for Event → Resume → Process
```

**Use Case**: Long-running workflows waiting for external events
