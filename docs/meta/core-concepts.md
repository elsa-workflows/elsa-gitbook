# Elsa Core Concepts

This document identifies major concepts and types in the elsa-core repository.

## Overview

Elsa Core is built around several key abstractions that enable workflow execution, activity management, and extensibility.


## Core Workflow Concepts

### Workflow Definition
A workflow definition is a blueprint that describes the structure and logic of a workflow. It contains:
- Activities and their configuration
- Connections between activities
- Variables and input/output definitions
- Triggers that can start the workflow

### Workflow Instance
A workflow instance represents a specific execution of a workflow definition. It maintains:
- Current execution state
- Variable values
- Execution history
- Bookmarks (suspension points)

### Activity
Activities are the building blocks of workflows. Each activity represents a unit of work that can:
- Execute logic (synchronous or asynchronous)
- Produce outcomes that determine execution flow
- Suspend execution (create bookmarks)
- Access and modify workflow variables

### Bookmark
Bookmarks represent suspension points in workflow execution. They enable:
- Long-running workflows that can pause and resume
- Event-driven workflows that wait for external triggers
- Correlation with external systems

### Trigger
Triggers define conditions or events that can start a workflow automatically:
- HTTP endpoints
- Timer/cron schedules  
- Message queue events
- Custom event triggers

- Entity Framework Core providers
- MongoDB providers
- In-memory stores for testing

## Extension Points

Elsa Core provides extensive extensibility through:

1. **Custom Activities** - Implement `IActivity` or derive from base activity classes
2. **Custom Triggers** - Implement `ITrigger` to create new workflow start conditions
3. **Custom Stores** - Implement store interfaces for custom persistence
4. **Middleware** - Workflow and activity execution pipelines support middleware
5. **Expression Evaluators** - Add support for custom expression languages
6. **Type Converters** - Custom type conversion for activity inputs/outputs

## Common Patterns

### Activity Execution Pattern
```csharp
public class MyActivity : CodeActivity
{
    protected override void Execute(ActivityExecutionContext context)
    {
        // Synchronous execution logic
    }
}

public class MyAsyncActivity : CodeActivity  
{
    protected override async ValueTask ExecuteAsync(ActivityExecutionContext context)
    {
        // Asynchronous execution logic
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

### Bookmark Pattern (Long-Running)
```csharp
public class WaitForEvent : Activity
{
    protected override void Execute(ActivityExecutionContext context)
    {
        // Create a bookmark to suspend execution
        context.CreateBookmark(new Bookmark("EventReceived"));
    }
}
```

### Workflow Definition Pattern
```csharp
public class MyWorkflow : WorkflowBase
{
    protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder)
    {
        builder
            .Root<Sequence>()
            .WithActivities(
                new WriteLine("Start"),
                new MyActivity(),
                new WriteLine("End")
            );
    }
}
```
