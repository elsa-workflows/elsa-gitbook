# Architecture Overview

This guide provides a high-level understanding of Elsa's architecture and what happens when a workflow executes. Whether you're extending Elsa, troubleshooting issues, or simply curious about how everything fits together, this overview will help you understand the system's core concepts and structure.

## What Happens When a Workflow Executes?

At a high level, when a workflow executes in Elsa:

1. **Dispatch**: A workflow is dispatched for execution via `IWorkflowDispatcher`, which enqueues the request
2. **Load**: The workflow definition is loaded from storage (or cache)
3. **Instantiate**: A workflow instance is created or resumed (if continuing from a bookmark)
4. **Execute**: Activities run sequentially or in parallel based on the workflow structure
5. **Bookmark (Optional)**: If an activity creates a bookmark, execution pauses and state is persisted
6. **Complete or Suspend**: The workflow either completes or suspends, waiting for external stimuli to resume

This lifecycle repeats as workflows are triggered, execute activities, wait for events, and continue execution.

## Core Concepts

### Execute vs Dispatch

Understanding the difference between **executing** and **dispatching** workflows is fundamental:

#### Execute (IWorkflowRunner)
- **Direct, synchronous execution** of a workflow in the current process
- No queuing or background processing
- Useful for testing, simple workflows, or when immediate results are needed
- Does not involve `IWorkflowDispatcher`

```csharp
// Direct execution
var result = await workflowRunner.RunAsync(
    new RunWorkflowRequest 
    { 
        DefinitionId = workflowId 
    });
```

#### Dispatch (IWorkflowDispatcher)
- **Asynchronous, queue-based** workflow execution
- Requests are enqueued and processed by background workers
- Supports distributed execution across multiple nodes
- Default approach for production workflows

```csharp
// Dispatching for background execution
await workflowDispatcher.DispatchAsync(
    new DispatchWorkflowDefinitionRequest 
    { 
        DefinitionId = workflowId 
    });
```

#### IWorkflowRuntime
- **High-level abstraction** that combines runtime management with persistence
- Provides client API for workflow operations (start, resume, cancel, etc.)
- Used by most applications for workflow lifecycle management
- Internally uses `IWorkflowDispatcher` for execution

For a deep dive into dispatching, see the [Workflow Dispatcher Architecture](workflow-dispatcher.md) guide.

### Bookmarks, Triggers, and Stimuli

These three concepts work together to enable event-driven, long-running workflows:

#### Bookmarks
A **bookmark** is a "pause point" in a workflow. When an activity creates a bookmark:
- The workflow's current state is persisted
- Execution suspends at that activity
- The bookmark waits for a matching stimulus to resume execution

Think of bookmarks as save points in a video game - the workflow can be resumed from exactly where it left off.

**Common activities that create bookmarks:**
- `Event` - Waits for a named event
- `Delay` - Waits for a timer
- `HTTP Endpoint` - Waits for an HTTP request
- `Send HTTP Request` (when configured to wait for response)

#### Triggers
A **trigger** is a special type of activity that starts a workflow automatically when certain conditions are met. Triggers:
- Create bookmarks when the workflow is published
- Listen for external events (HTTP requests, timers, messages, etc.)
- Automatically start new workflow instances when triggered
- Are typically the first activity in a workflow

**Example triggers:**
- `HTTP Endpoint` - Starts workflow when an HTTP request arrives
- `Timer` - Starts workflow on a schedule (cron, interval, etc.)
- `Message Received` - Starts workflow when a message arrives

#### Stimuli
A **stimulus** is an external event that resumes a suspended workflow. Stimuli:
- Are dispatched into the system via `IWorkflowDispatcher`
- Match against existing bookmarks
- Resume workflows from their bookmarked position

The relationship:
1. Activity creates a **bookmark** (workflow pauses)
2. External event occurs and generates a **stimulus**
3. Stimulus matches bookmark and resumes execution

```
Workflow -> [Activity] -> Bookmark Created -> Persisted
                                    ↓
External Event -> Stimulus Dispatched -> Bookmark Matched -> Workflow Resumes
```

### Workflow Runtimes

The **workflow runtime** is the execution environment that manages workflow lifecycle and state. Key responsibilities:

#### State Management
- Tracks workflow instances and their current state
- Persists bookmarks and activity data
- Manages workflow variables and outputs

#### Execution Coordination
- Schedules activities for execution
- Handles activity outcomes and connections
- Manages parallel execution paths

#### Event Processing
- Receives and routes stimuli to bookmarks
- Handles workflow triggers
- Coordinates distributed execution

#### Integration Points
The runtime integrates with several subsystems:
- **Persistence**: Storage for workflow definitions and instances
- **Dispatcher**: Queuing and background execution
- **Activity Registry**: Discovery of available activities
- **Expression Evaluators**: Dynamic value resolution

### Multitenancy (Conceptual Overview)

Elsa supports **multitenancy** - running multiple isolated tenants in a single deployment:

#### Tenant Isolation
- Each tenant has isolated workflow definitions, instances, and data
- Tenants cannot access each other's workflows or data
- Tenant context is established early in the request pipeline

#### Tenant Resolution
- Tenants are identified via tenant ID (from headers, routes, claims, etc.)
- Tenant resolver strategies can be customized
- Default tenant is available for single-tenant scenarios

#### Use Cases
- **SaaS Applications**: Each customer is a tenant with isolated workflows
- **Multi-Organization**: Departments or divisions with separate workflows
- **Development/Staging/Production**: Logical separation within a deployment

For detailed multitenancy setup, see the [Multitenancy Introduction](../../multitenancy/introduction.md) guide.

## Typical Workflow Execution Flow

Here's a detailed look at what happens during a typical workflow execution:

### 1. Trigger Event
```
HTTP Request -> Elsa Server -> Trigger Matched -> Dispatch Workflow
```

### 2. Workflow Dispatch
```
IWorkflowDispatcher.DispatchAsync()
    ↓
Enqueue Request -> Background Worker Picks Up
    ↓
Load Workflow Definition -> Create/Resume Instance
```

### 3. Activity Execution
```
For each activity in sequence:
    ↓
Load Activity Definition
    ↓
Evaluate Input Expressions (variables, outputs, etc.)
    ↓
Execute Activity Logic
    ↓
Process Outcomes (determine next activities)
    ↓
[If bookmark created] -> Persist State & Suspend
[Otherwise] -> Continue to next activity
```

### 4. Completion or Suspension
```
[All activities complete]
    ↓
Workflow Status = Completed
    ↓
Persist Final State -> Trigger Completion Events

[Bookmark created]
    ↓
Workflow Status = Suspended
    ↓
Persist Bookmark & State -> Wait for Stimulus
```

### 5. Resume from Bookmark (if suspended)
```
External Event -> Stimulus Dispatched
    ↓
Match Bookmark -> Load Workflow Instance
    ↓
Resume from Bookmarked Activity
    ↓
Continue Execution (goto step 3)
```

## Understanding the Module System

Elsa's architecture is built around a **module and feature system** that enables clean extensibility:

### Modules
A **module** is a container for related features. The `IModule` interface represents a configuration point where features can be registered and configured.

### Features
A **feature** is a self-contained unit of functionality that:
- Registers services with dependency injection
- Adds activities to the activity registry
- Configures workflow options
- Can depend on other features

### Registration Pattern
Features are registered using a fluent API:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddElsa(elsa => elsa
    .UseWorkflowRuntime()
    .UseHttp()
    .UseEmail()
    .UseJavaScript()
);
```

Each `UseXyz()` method adds a feature to the module, which then configures the necessary services.

For detailed information on creating custom modules and plugins, see the [Modules and Plugins](../extensibility/modules-and-plugins.md) guide.
