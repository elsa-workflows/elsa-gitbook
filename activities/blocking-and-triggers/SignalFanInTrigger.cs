/// <summary>
/// A trigger activity that waits for multiple signals with the same aggregation key.
/// This demonstrates the fan-in pattern where multiple parallel operations must complete
/// before the workflow continues.
/// 
/// Key Concepts:
/// - Inherits from Trigger base class (Elsa.Workflows.Trigger)
/// - Implements GetTriggerPayloads for trigger indexing
/// - Uses IsTriggerOfWorkflow to handle two modes:
///   * When starting a workflow: completes immediately with the triggering signal
///   * When used mid-workflow: creates bookmarks to wait for signals
/// - Aggregates signals using an aggregation key
/// - Completes when the required number of signals is received
/// 
/// Use Cases:
/// - Wait for multiple service callbacks
/// - Coordinate parallel approval workflows
/// - Aggregate data from multiple sources
/// - Implement fan-in synchronization patterns
/// 
/// Example:
/// // In a workflow
/// var fanIn = new SignalFanInTrigger
/// {
///     SignalName = new("OrderProcessed"),
///     AggregationKey = new("Order-12345"),
///     RequiredCount = new(3) // Wait for 3 signals
/// };
/// 
/// // Send signals from external code
/// await workflowResumer.ResumeAsync(
///     new BookmarkStimulus
///     {
///         BookmarkName = "SignalFanIn",
///         Payload = new SignalPayload
///         {
///             SignalName = "OrderProcessed",
///             AggregationKey = "Order-12345"
///         }
///     },
///     new Dictionary<string, object>
///     {
///         ["SignalData"] = new SignalData
///         {
///             SignalName = "OrderProcessed",
///             Source = "PaymentService",
///             Data = new Dictionary<string, object> { ["Amount"] = 100.00 }
///         }

/*
 * REGISTRATION
 * ============
 * 
 * In your Program.cs or Startup.cs:
 * 
 * builder.Services.AddElsa(elsa =>
 * {
 *     // Register the custom trigger
 *     elsa.AddActivity<SignalFanInTrigger>();
 *     
 *     // Ensure trigger indexing is enabled (it is by default)
 *     elsa.UseWorkflowManagement();
 * });
 * 
 * 
 * USAGE IN WORKFLOW
 * =================
 * 
 * As a workflow starter (trigger):
 * 
 * public class OrderProcessingWorkflow : WorkflowBase
 * {
 *     protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder)
 *     {
 *         var fanIn = new SignalFanInTrigger
 *         {
 *             SignalName = new("OrderProcessed"),
 *             AggregationKey = new("Order-12345"),
 *             RequiredCount = new(3), // Wait for payment, inventory, and shipping
 *             CanStartWorkflow = true  // Important: allows this trigger to start workflows
 *         };
 *         
 *         var complete = new WriteLine("All order processing steps completed!");
 *         
 *         builder.Root = new Sequence
 *         {
 *             Activities = { fanIn, complete }
 *         };
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * As a mid-workflow activity (bookmark):
 * 
 * public class OrderWorkflow : WorkflowBase
 * {
 *     protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder)
 *     {
 *         builder.Root = new Sequence
 *         {
 *             Activities =
 *             {
 *                 new WriteLine("Starting order processing..."),
 *                 new SignalFanInTrigger
 *                 {
 *                     SignalName = new("OrderProcessed"),
 *                     AggregationKey = new("Order-12345"),
 *                     RequiredCount = new(3)
 *                     // CanStartWorkflow not needed here - used mid-workflow
 *                 },
 *                 new WriteLine("All signals received!")
 *             }
 *         };
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * SENDING SIGNALS
 * ===============
 * 
 * From a service or controller:
 * 
 * public class OrderService
 * {
 *     private readonly IWorkflowResumer _workflowResumer;
 *     
 *     public async Task NotifyPaymentProcessed(string orderId, decimal amount)
 *     {
 *         var stimulus = new BookmarkStimulus
 *         {
 *             BookmarkName = "SignalFanIn",
 *             Payload = new SignalPayload
 *             {
 *                 SignalName = "OrderProcessed",
 *                 AggregationKey = $"Order-{orderId}"
 *             }
 *         };
 *         
 *         var input = new Dictionary<string, object>
 *         {
 *             ["SignalData"] = new SignalData
 *             {
 *                 SignalName = "OrderProcessed",
 *                 Source = "PaymentService",
 *                 ReceivedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
 *                 Data = new Dictionary<string, object>
 *                 {
 *                     ["Amount"] = amount,
 *                     ["OrderId"] = orderId
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         };
 *         
 *         await _workflowResumer.ResumeAsync(stimulus, input);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * FAN-IN PATTERNS
 * ===============
 * 
 * The fan-in pattern is useful for coordinating multiple parallel operations:
 * 
 * 1. Multiple Service Callbacks:
 *    - Payment processing, inventory check, shipping calculation
 *    - All must complete before order confirmation
 * 
 * 2. Parallel Approvals:
 *    - Manager approval, finance approval, legal approval
 *    - All approvals required before proceeding
 * 
 * 3. Data Aggregation:
 *    - Collect data from multiple sources
 *    - Process when all data is available
 * 
 * 4. Batch Processing:
 *    - Wait for multiple batch jobs to complete
 *    - Continue when all jobs finish
 * 
 * 
 * TRIGGER INDEXING
 * ================
 * 
 * Elsa uses trigger indexing to efficiently match incoming events to workflows.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. When a workflow is published, GetTriggerPayloads is called
 * 2. The returned payloads are hashed and stored in the trigger index
 * 3. When a signal is sent, Elsa computes a hash of the stimulus payload
 * 4. Matching workflows are found using the index and started/resumed
 * 
 * This allows Elsa to quickly find relevant workflows without scanning
 * all workflow definitions.
 * 
 * 
 * API REFERENCE
 * =============
 * 
 * Core APIs used (from elsa-core repository):
 * 
 * - Trigger (base class)
 *   Namespace: Elsa.Workflows
 *   Base class for all trigger activities.
 * 
 * - GetTriggerPayloads(TriggerIndexingContext)
 *   Returns payloads for trigger indexing.
 *   Called during workflow definition loading.
 * 
 * - TriggerIndexingContext
 *   Namespace: Elsa.Workflows.Models
 *   Context for accessing activity inputs during indexing.
 * 
 * - ActivityExecutionContext.GetVariable<T>(string)
 *   Gets a workflow variable value.
 * 
 * - ActivityExecutionContext.SetVariable(string, object)
 *   Sets a workflow variable value.
 * 
 * - BookmarkStimulus
 *   Namespace: Elsa.Workflows.Runtime.Stimuli
 *   Used to match and resume bookmarks.
